## Core Concepts

- **Root Account**

  - Account created when you setup your AWS account. This account has complete admin access.
  - The root account **should not** be used for daily access.
  - Always setup MFA on root account

- **Users, Groups, and Roles**

  - **Users**
    - Individuals who are logging into the AWS console or using API commands
    - Have no permissions when first created
  - **Groups**
    - A collection of users under one set of permissions
  - **Roles**
    - Allows you to create and assign roles to AWS users, applications, or services to give access to AWS resources

- **IAM Policy**

  - JSON document
  - Policies define one or more permissions
  - Can be associated with a user, group, or role

  {
  "Version" : "2022-12-1",
  "Statement":
  {
  "Effect" : "Allow",
  "Action" : "_",
  "Resource" : "_"
  }
  }

- **IAM Access Keys**
  - New users can be assigned an **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key** when they are created
  - Access keys are used for progrommatic access to the AWS console
  - The access key ID and secret access key cannot be used to login to the AWS console
  - The secret access key can only be viewed once when it's created, but can be downloaded. The Access Key can be viewed.
  - If you lose the secret access key, you will need to regenerate new keys
